// The Jev provider: TypeSafe's System One API over native fetch, built against
// the live responses in test/fixtures/jev-live-2026-10-08.json.
//
// It translates in both directions and judges nothing itself: evaluateDecision
// still validates every answer against the pack and decides the status.
//
// Request. One run is one call (plus bounded retries). TypeSafe judges one
// `state` per call, so every question must declare the same inputs; a pack
// whose questions declare different inputs is rejected rather than split. A
// Choice question's labels become its criteria and a Noul question is sent as
// a yes/no question. Score questions are rejected: no live Score reply has been
// captured, so their mapping would be a guess.
//
// Reply. A Choice answer is its choice, with that choice's probability. A Noul
// answer is TypeSafe's P(yes) = p: `yes` with probability p when p >= 0.5,
// otherwise `no` with probability 1 - p. A tie counts as `yes`, so a coin flip
// escalates rather than passes. The model TypeSafe reports is the resolved
// model; a reply that reports none is malformed. Usage keeps its token counts.
//
// Failures. No response (a network error) is `network` and 429/529 is
// `rate-limit`; both are retried. Any other 5xx is `server-error`, and a 2xx
// whose body breaks off mid-read is `interrupted-response`: no answer, so
// `unknown`, but not retried, since the request may already have been served. Any other non-2xx status (a redirect, a
// rejected key, a refused request) is a rejection, which is `error`, as is a
// 2xx body that is not JSON or is larger than MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES; a body is
// never read past that limit. The HTTP plumbing is shared in common.mjs.
